There are three commands in for loop first setting the loop variable to an initial value,the second is a logical operation which specifies when the loop ends and the third is changing the value of loop variable after each iteration.First `i` is intialized to 1,then it checks whether `i` is less than 10.After that the code in the for loop is execute then value of `i` is incremented by 1.The loop ends when `i=10`.

{% capture code %}
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1;i<10;i++)
    {
        cout<<i<<' ';
    }
    return 0;
}
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="cpp" %}
