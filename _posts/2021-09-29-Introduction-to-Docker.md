I have been playing around with Docker during the last few days ,and I am quite impressed by its abilities. I am writing this blog to share what I have learnt by trying to dockerize a simple Flask app.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open source containerizing platform, It enables developers package their applications into containers.

## What is a Container?

According to [Google](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-containers),

> Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.

## What are the advantages of Docker?

The major advantage of using docker is that you do not need to setup your application again and again for different servers, you can just create a docker image once and then deploy it easily on other servers. It also helps when different applications require different versions dependencies as running them in separate containers prevents dependency conflict.


## Building the Application

Let us take a simple Flask app and try to dockerize it. 

Code of the app:

{% capture code %}
from flask import Flask
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import errorcode

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def connect():
    try:
        mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
            host="localhost",
            user="docker_user",
            password="Docker@123",
            database="docker"
        )
        return "Connected"
    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        if err.errno == errorcode.ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR:
            return "Something is wrong with your user name or password"
        elif err.errno == errorcode.ER_BAD_DB_ERROR:
            return "Database does not exist"
        else:
            return str(err)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="python" %}

Requirements of the app:

{% capture code %}
mysql-connector-python
flask
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="text" %}

The app just tries to connect to MySQL as user `docker_user` to access database `docker` and returns
`Connected` if the connection is successful.

Now we need to create this user and database in MySQL.
Start the MySQL client and run the following commands,


{% capture code %}
CREATE DATABASE docker;
CREATE USER docker_user@'localhost' identified by 'Docker@123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON docker.* TO docker_user;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="sql" %}

This first creates the database `docker`, then it creates the user `docker_user` and then grants privileges of the database `docker` to `docker_user`.

Now after running the app and visiting it in the browser we see,

## Dockerizing the Application

To create an image from the application, we would need to write a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile for this application is,

{% capture code %}
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ARG FLASK_PORT=5000
ENV FLASK_PORT=$FLASK_PORT
ENTRYPOINT python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${FLASK_PORT}
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="Dockerfile" %}

Here we are first taking a base image of python3.9 which already has python and pip installed, then we are a creating a working directory so that we can write relative paths. We then copy our `requirements.txt` to our working directory and install the packages needed. Finally, we copy our code, taking `port` as an environment variable, and run the app.

**Note: it is important to run the flask app on `0.0.0.0` else we will note be able to forward it.**  

Now, we can build the image using,

{% capture code %}
docker build --tag flask-docker .
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="bash" %}

Now using `docker images` we can see that our image has been built,

![docker images output](/assets/docker-images.png)

Now for MySQL, there is already an official image on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) (it is a website from where docker gets images uploaded by other people), we just need to pass our environment variables,

{% capture code %}
docker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="Docker@123" -e MYSQL_DATABASE="docker" -e MYSQL_USER="docker_user" -e MYSQL_PASSWORD="Docker@123" -d mysql
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="bash" %}

Here `-d` is for running in detached mode, by default docker is attached to the terminal so when we close it our application will also close.

Now, let's run our app on port `5000`,

{% capture code %}
docker run --name app -e FLASK_PORT="5000" -p 5000:5000 -d flask-docker
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="bash" %}

The `-p` flag maps the port `5000` of our pc to `5000` of the Docker conatiner.

## Networks

As we can see our app cannot reach the database even thought the database is running this is because they are running in separate containers. With Docker we can add them both in the same network.

First let us create a network,

{% capture code %}
docker network create my_network
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="bash" %}


Then, changing the host in our app.py to name of the MySQL container `db` and rebuilding the image,

{% capture code %}
from flask import Flask
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import errorcode

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def connect():
    try:
        mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
            host="db",
            user="docker_user",
            password="Docker@123",
            database="docker"
        )
        return "Connected"
    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        if err.errno == errorcode.ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR:
            return "Something is wrong with your user name or password"
        elif err.errno == errorcode.ER_BAD_DB_ERROR:
            return "Database does not exist"
        else:
            return str(err)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="python" %}

Finally, we rerun our db and app with this network,

{% capture code %}
 docker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="Docker@123" -e MYSQL_DATABASE="docker" -e MYSQL_USER="docker_user" -e MYSQL_PASSWORD="Docker@123" -d  --network my_network mysql
 docker run --name app -e FLASK_PORT="5000" -p 5000:5000 -d --network my_network flask-docker
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="bash" %}

Now going to `http://localhost:5000/`,

## Docker-compose 

As you can probably see that the commands we have to run have become very long, and we need to rerun then every time we change our image or our configuration. The solution to this is `docker-compose`, we just need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
For our current setup:

{% capture code %}
version: "3.9"
services: 
  app: 
    image: flask-docker
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_PORT=5000
  
  db:
    image: mysql
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Docker@123
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=docker
      - MYSQL_USER=docker_user
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=Docker@123
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="yml" %}

**Note: Different versions of docker-compose has different syntax see [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/).**

Now to run our setup we just need to run,

{% capture code %}
docker-compose up -d
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html code=code lang="bash" %}

`docker-compose` already creates a default network, so we do not need to create another.

## Conclusion

Now we have reduced our setup to a single command after installing `docker` and `docker-compose`. 

By default, data stored in Docker is written in the writable container layer which no longer exists after the container is destroyed, and it is also difficult to move. For persistent data you should use [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). 

You are encouraged to learn more about docker at the [official docs](https://docs.docker.com).
